### Capability
Capability is an subjective view of referece monitoring in an operating system. It is a different view from the ACL(access control list) which is widely used in the Lnux kernel. ACL for an object(e.g. a file) determine who has the access permission to this object. However, capability is like a key which owned by subjects. Determining who has the access permission is checking if a subject as a key to operate on a file. For people who is comfortable with Linux, they need time to make transition from ACL to capability.
