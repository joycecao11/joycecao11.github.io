## About me
<img align="right" width="150" height="150" src="/img/xuechun.JPG">

I am a MSc student in [the Computer Science departmentat the University of British Columbia](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/) in Vancouver, Canada. I am also a graduate research assistant supervised by [Prof. Thomas Pasquier](https://tfjmp.org/) in [Systopia Lab](https://systopia.cs.ubc.ca/).

I obtained my Bachelor degree from UBC in 2022 with a combined major in Computer Science and Statistics. Although I have some Statistics background, I still like systems, especially memory related. I hope in the future I can do more research on machine learning related system topics ;-).
