## About me
<img align="right" width="150" height="150" src="/img/self/xuechun.JPG">

I am a Master of Science, PhD-track student in [the Computer Science department, University of British Columbia](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/). I am also a graduate research assistant under the supervision of [Prof. Thomas Pasquier](https://tfjmp.org/) in [Systopia Lab](https://systopia.cs.ubc.ca/).

I obtained my Bachelor degree from UBC with a combined major in Computer Science and Statistics. Although I have some Statistics background, I still like systems. My research interests are Operating System and Memory Management.
